# Or-Gate
In this project, I designed a simple OR gate using Cadence Virtuoso. The process involves creating both the circuit and its corresponding cellview for better visualization and understanding. Below is a breakdown of the steps and methodologies followed.

--> Introduction
An OR gate is a fundamental component in digital logic circuits. It performs a logical operation where the output is high (1) if at least one of the inputs is high (1). The objective of this project is to design a working OR gate in Cadence Virtuoso, and create a cellview for better visualization of the design.

--> Cellview Creation
To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the design, I created a cellview that visually represents the OR gate. This cellview can be used in future designs and integrated into larger systems.

Purpose: Cellview makes the design reusable and easier to understand.
Hierarchy: The OR gate cellview can be instantiated in larger circuits like combinational logic circuits.

--> Simulation
After completing the schematic and layout, I ran simulations to verify the OR gate's functionality. The following simulations were performed:

DC Analysis: Verified the voltage levels for different input combinations.
Transient Analysis: Checked the switching behavior and timing.
